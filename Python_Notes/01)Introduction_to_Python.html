            <ul>
                <li>Python is a most popular,high-level,object oriented Programming language </li>
                <li><strong class="text">High-Level:</strong>Python is easy to write and understand because it hides complex computer details.</li>
                <li><strong class="text">Object-Oriented:</strong>It uses a style of coding that's good for organizing and reusing code.</li>
                <li><strong class="text">Interpreted:</strong>You don't need to compile code; Python reads and runs it directly.</li>
                <li><strong class="text">Interpreter:</strong>It's a program that executes Python code step by step, helping with errors and making it easy to work with.</li>
                <li>Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was developed by the Python Software Foundation and has become a widely used programming language known for its simplicity and versatility.</li>
