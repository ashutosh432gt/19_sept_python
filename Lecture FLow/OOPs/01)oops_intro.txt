oops : object oriented programming system

oop which based on below concepts

1)Class
2)object
3)Encapsulation
4)Inheritance
5)Polymorphism
6)Abstraction
7)Aggregation

=>class : class is a userdefined data type
            which contain data member and member function

=>object : object is an instance or a variable of a class
           using of object we can access properties of class

=>Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and 
                  methods of a class in a single unit

=>Inheritance : Inheritance is a process of creating a new class by 
               using the properties and methods of existing class

=>Polymorphism : Polymorphism is a process of using same name for different 
                 objects

=>Abstraction : Abstraction is a process of removing the unnecessary details
               from a class and showing only the essential details

=>Aggregation : Aggregation is a process of combining two classes into a 
               single class
